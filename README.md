# AVR_ISEP
________________

In this repositorium I put some code, which helped me pass the Microprocessadores e Microcontroladores course at ISEP in Porto, during my Erasmus :) <br/>
Rather, this repository will be like a souvenir, but I'll try to add some worthy things that may be helpful ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

I'm linux user, so I used MPLAB X IDE, because this IDE has built-in simulator for AVR mcu. If you need more worthy info (about how to run code, etc.), I hope you will find it in README in these folders. JP100%
