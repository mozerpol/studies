At the beginning of the main file I defined a few numbers, that will be sequentially displayed on the two 7seg displays. There are two definition groups, one for display number 1 and the other one for display number 2, because they are one connected to the other ports and pins. At the end of the project, I defined two arrays (numbers7seg1 and numbers7seg2), that are stored in the SRAM memory, for this purpose the BYTE directive was used to reserve the suitable number of bytes, which must be in the area of the DSEG directive. In the subroutine initializePointer has been initialized pointer, that points to the start of the array. Next the ports to which the button is connected and the two 7seg displays are initialized. Main loop waits for pressing the PC0 or PC1 button and compare the current value indicated by Z. If the PC1 button was pressed jump to nextVal and increment the value on the 7seg display. At the same time, the value shown on the second display should be decremented, but unfortunately it doesn't. The reason is that the pointer Z points to the array numbers7seg1 and the display 7seg gets its values from there. When we go out of the range of numbers7seg1 then the second display will start to show the correct values, at the same time the first display will show the mishmash. The delay loop was used for the delays as in the previous programs.
