At the beginning of the main file I defined a few numbers, that will be sequentially displayed on the 7seg display. After initialization (port settings and displaying the start number on the display 7seg - zero) the program goes to the main loop. The main loop waits for the pressing of the PC1 button, if this happen it jumps to increaseNumb subroutine. increaseNumb successively increments the values on the 7seg display. Between each change of the value on the 7seg display jump to a subroutine delay, for approximately one second. If we press the SW0 button when the number 5 is displayed, we will change the order of displaying the numbers, i.e. from 5 to 0. If the SW0 button isn't pressed when the number 5 is displayed, the countdown will start from the beginning, i.e. from 0 to 5. If we are in a decreaseNumb loop, that 7seg displays numbers in the order 5 -> 0 and when 7seg displaying the number 0 we press the SW0 button, we will change the order of displaying the numbers, i.e. from 0 to 5.
